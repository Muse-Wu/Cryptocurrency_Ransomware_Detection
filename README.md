# Cryptocurrency_Ransomware_Detection

**Abstract**

The inception of cryptocurrencies has allowed for crimes that weren't previously possible: ransomware attacks. Per Wikipedia, Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. The perpetrators of ransomware attacks are increasingly requesting bitcoin for their ransom, because of the near-anonymity bitcoin transactions provide. What if there were some way, though, to identify that a bitcoin address was associated with ransomware based on the characteristics of individual bitcoin transactions? And that is the problem we have chosen to investigate.

**Result**

K-Nearest Neighbors is a better model to describe the data.
